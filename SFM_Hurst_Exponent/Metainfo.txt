Description: 'Downloads BTC/USDT transaction data from Binance API aggregated per minute from 2017-01-01 until 2020-01-30. Selects close prices and divides them into 1000 subsets.
For each subset, Hurst Exponent is calculated and an AR Model is fitted. The close price for the following 7 periods is made and MSE is calculated. 
One-sided t-test indicates that large Hurst Exponents are related to a smaller MSE, hence indicates prediction quality.'
